    "## General Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All calculations need to be done in the functions (that includes any formatting)\n",
    "- Name your functions exactly as written in the problem statement\n",
    "- Please have your functions return the answer rather than printing it inside the function\n",
    "- Do not make a separate input() statement. The functions will be passed the input as shown in the examples\n",
    "- The examples given are samples of how we will test/grade your code. Please ensure your functions output the same information\n",
    "- Answer format is graded - please match the examples\n",
    "- Other than for Part 5, user / function inputs do not need to be validated or checked. (For example, if the problem states input an integer we will check it by inputting an integer)\n",
    "- Docstrings and comments in your code are strongly suggested but won't be graded\n",
    "- In each code block, do NOT delete the ### comment at the top of a cell (it's needed for the auto-grading!)\n",
    "  - You will get 80 points from the autograder for this assignment and 20 points will be hidden. That is, passing all of the visible tests will give you 80 points. Make sure you are meeting the requirements of the problem to get the other 20 points!\n",
    "  - Do NOT print or put other statements in the grading cells. The autograder will fail - if this happens please delete those statments and re-submit \n",
    "  - You may upload and run the autograder as many times as needed in your time window to get full points\n",
    "  - The assignment needs to be named HW_Unit_05.ipynb to be graded from the autograder\n",
    "  - The examples given are samples of how we will test/grade your code. Please ensure your code outputs the same information.\n",
    "    - In addition to the given example, the autograder will test other examples\n",
    "    - Each autograder test tells you what input it is using\n",
    "  - Once complete, the autograder will show each tests, if that test is passed or failed, and your total score\n",
    "  - The autograder fails for a couple of reasons:\n",
    "    - Your code crashes with that input (for example: `Test Failed: string index out of range`)\n",
    "    - Your code output does not match the 'correct' output (for example: `Test Failed: '1 2 3 2 1' != '1 4 6 4 1'`)"

    "For this question, please write three functions as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sum_digits`: a function which takes an `int` and returns the sum of its (positive value) digits. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `diff_sum_digits`: a function that \"wraps\" `sum_digits` in that it calls `sum_digits` from within it. Use the `diff_sum_digits` function to compute the absolute value of the input number, minus the sum of digits of the input number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `wraps_diff_sum_digits`: a function that \"wraps\" `diff_sum_digits`. If `diff_sum_digits` returns a result that has more than one digit replace the result with the `diff_sum_digits` of the result. Do this repeatedly until the result has just one digit, then display it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Note: The nested functions (all three functions above) will always run through once - even if the inputted number is only one digit!\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this with an example:\n",
    "- The input number is 20 as in: `wraps_diff_sum_digits(20)`\n",
    "- `wraps_diff_sum_digits` calls `diff_sum_digits(20)` which calls `sum_digits(20)`\n",
    "- `sum_digits` adds the numbers (2+0 = 2) returns a 2, `diff_sum_digits` subtracts (20-2 = 18) and returns this to `wraps_diff_sum_digits`\n",
    "- `wraps_diff_sum_digits` sees that the number 18 stills has 2 digits and calls `diff_sum_digits(18)` which calls `sum_digits(18)`\n",
    "- `sum_digits` add the numbers (1+8 = 9) returns a 9, `diff_sum_digits` subtracts (18-9 = 9) and returns this to `wraps_diff_sum_digits`\n",
    "- `wraps_diff_sum_digits` sees that the number 9 only has 1 digit - stops and returns the value 9.\n",
